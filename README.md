- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattsexton-booking
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Applications that prioritize user experience, performance, accessibility, progressive enhancement, dynamic updates, and awesomesauce
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to herd cats with ADHD
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on evangelizing the amazingness that web applications provide
- 📫 How to reach me: whisper my name to the north. It's not very effective, because I probably won't hear you, so email probably works better, even though its not much more effective than a whisper :D
